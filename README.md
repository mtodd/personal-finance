This is an outline of our personal finance plan. I'm sharing this as a starting
point for others to form their own plan, and also to gather feedback on what we
can improve. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [file an
issue](https://github.com/jch/personal-finance/issues) or email me at
jollyjerry@gmail.com.

## Debt

* Pay off loans, except ones with very low interest. e.g. 0.9% car loan. Builds credit, less than inflation.
* Never keep a balance on credit cards, auto-pay everything in full
* Ask for a credit increase every year, don't over do it
* Carry less than 1/3 of credit limit in credit card balance
* [Check credit score](https://www.annualcreditreport.com) once a year
* Refinance for a lower interest rate on mortgages or large loans
* Consider [401k](https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics-Loans) loans. Up to $50k, prime rate, and interest and principal are both paid back into the account
* Use a credit card with rewards like the [Chase Reserve ](https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/sapphire/reserve) with travel credits (up to $300/year) and 3x points on travel and dining and 50k bonus points.

## Liquidity

* 12 months of expenses in a high interest savings account
* Budget out large purchases into monthly amounts to save. e.g. car, wedding, vacation

## Medical

* Health Savings Account (HSA). Maximize employer contributions.
  * Do not invest until balance would exceed minimum to avoid fees
  * Choose a plan that allows investment in index funds like Wells Fargo or Health Savings Administrators
  * Continue to pay medical expenses out of pocket when possible to maximize tax deferred growth

## Retirement

* Calculate whether Traditional or Roth contribution makes sense for your tax bracket. [calculator](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2qua49/roth_vs_traditional_calculator/cn9l3x2). Typically, high income/high tax rate => traditional, low income/low tax rate => roth. Save on taxes now vs save on taxes later.
* Maximize contributions to tax advantaged accounts: 401k, IRA, HSA.
* [Backdoor Roth IRA](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth_IRA). Pay special attention to [IRA aggregation rule and pro-rata distributions](https://www.kitces.com/blog/the-impact-of-the-ira-aggregation-rule-on-after-tax-distributions-roth-conversions-60-day-rollovers-rmds-and-72t-payments/
* [After-tax 401k contributions](https://www.kitces.com/blog/irs-notice-2014-54-acquiesces-on-splitting-after-tax-401k-contributions-for-roth-conversion/) and [rollovers](https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Rollovers-of-After-Tax-Contributions-in-Retirement-Plans)
* Choose low cost index funds.
* Charitable giving. Contributions to eligible organizations can be itemized as a deduction

## Children

* [529 plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/529_plan)
* [Vanguard 529](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/college/vanguard529)
  * $3,000 minimum
  * Age based options. I'm using the "moderate" option: starts at 75/25 stock/bond allocation
* Dependent care FSA. [IRS publication 503](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p503.pdf)

## Tools

* Monthly review of spending with [Mint](https://www.mint.com). Categorize
  spending, note any large differences in monthly trends. Link all accounts.
* Vanguard brokerage account. Using this for our Roth IRA and IRA.
* Setup direct deposit and auto-pay for all accounts.
* [FI planning tool](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2zhw7t/heres_an_fi_planning_tool_i_made_that_might_help/). Interesting to play with, but no longer using it.
